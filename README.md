# CovPY Auto Reporte

This project was created as an initiative by Penguin Academy to build technology to smoothen the peak impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Paraguayan Health System.

🐧🇵🇾🦠

This project is an auto reporting system, allowing anyone to access it and report their symptoms and gat a quick feedback what steps to take next as well as allowing to generate data on the situation.

## Demo and Contributing

As we received many requests for collaboration, we decided to clean up and open source this repository. It is entierly built on open source technology and can be a starting point to build an application for your country or specific target group.

### Contibution Guidelines ♥️
We welcome contributions! Please check the open issues to see what is needed at the moment. If those issues are not specified well or there is nothing you can work on, contact us or open an issue to see if there is something else available you can work on.

### Demo 👀

A demo is available [here](https://covpy.netlify.com/). And the visual documentation (Storybook) is available [here](https://covpy-book.netlify.com/).

### Development 👩‍💻

This project uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). So you can run `yarn storybook` to start a storybook development server and enjoy the comfort to develop components and visually test them.


## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

There are further scripts and documentation [available here](create-react-app.md)

## Deployment 🦸‍♀️

You can use [netlify](https://netlify.com/) to host the web app and setup a continous building process from the master branch.
You will have to add the environment variables for your Firebase Backend in netlify!
👉Also make sure to secure the Firebase Backend as it is open to anyone to read the data in there per default! 

## Other

This project uses [Froala Design Blocks](https://github.com/froala/design-blocks) an open source design framework with blocks  based on the Bootstrap Library. They are the building blocks for beautiful websites. We converted the components to react and you can find them under [/src/templates] and in [Storybook](https://covpy-book.netlify.com/?path=/story/template--ctas)
